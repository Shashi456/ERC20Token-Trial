# ERC20Token-Trial

This was a trial way to make an erc 20 token with existing code from some tutorial . This was done on the Ropsten Test Net , mainnet deploy
deployments take actual ether which would cost money . 

You also use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)for all of this and that is a good plugin to add to run ethereum based websites. 

Solidity seems really interesting and now i have somewhat understood ethereum and the erc20 tokens more than i used to.

Use the remix solidity compiler and let the settings remain as they were , errors are too common and take time to solve since its a developing community.


Some nice tutorials to look at would be :

My contract Address :  	0x9d47d02a4fc617ae8d9c3723ee32b115554edc5b

The token is Paws [PAW] .
