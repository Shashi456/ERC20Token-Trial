# ERC20Token-Trial

This was a trial way to make an erc 20 token with existing code from some tutorial . This was done on the Ropsten Test Net , mainnet deploy
deployments take actual ether which would cost money . 

Solidity seems really interesting and now i have somewhat understood ethereum and the erc20 tokens more than i used to.

Use the remix solidity compiler and let the settings remain as they were , errors are too common and take time to solve since its a developing community.
